## i18n implementation

ManageIQ uses [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) for internationalization.
In particular, the project uses the following gems to make internationalization work:

* [gettext](http://ruby-gettext.github.io)
* [fast_gettext](https://github.com/grosser/fast_gettext)
* [gettext_i18n_rails](https://github.com/grosser/gettext_i18n_rails)
* [gettext_i18n_rails_js](https://github.com/webhippie/gettext_i18n_rails_js)
* [rails-i18n](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n)

## Gettext usage

ManageIQ supports internationalization of strings in ruby and haml sources as well as JavaScript.

### Ruby / HAML

The following gettext routines are supported in Ruby and HAML sources:

* `_(msgid)` – translates `msgid` and returns the translated string
  * [rubydoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gettext/GetText#gettext-instance_method)
* `N_(msgid)` – dynamic translation: this will put `msgid` in the gettext catalog but the string will not be translated by gettext at this time (see delayed translation below)
  * [rubydoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gettext/GetText#N_-instance_method)
* `n_(msgid, msgid_plural, n)` – returns either translated `msgid` or its translated plural form (`msgid_plural`) depending on `n`, a number determining the count (i.e. number above 1 means plural form)
  * [rubydoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gettext/GetText#ngettext-instance_method)
* `s_(msgid, seperator = "|")` – translates `msgid`, but if there are no localized text, it returns a last part of `msgid` separated by `separator` (`|` by default)
  * [rubydoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gettext/GetText#sgettext-instance_method)
* `ns_(msgid, msgid_plural, n, seperator = "|")` – similar to the `n_()`, but if there is no localized text, it returns a last part of `msgid` separated by `separator`.
  * [rubydoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gettext/GetText#ngettext-instance_method)

### JavaScript

Internationalization in JavaScript is done with `gettext_i18n_rails_js` gem. The gem extends `gettext_i18n_rails` making the `.po` files available to client side javascript as JSON files.

Unlike Ruby / HAML sources, JavaScript uses `__()` *(i.e. two underscores rather than one)* to invoke gettext. This is done to avoid conflicts with other JavaScript modules.

The gettext routines supported in JavaScript sources:

* `__(msgid)`
* `n_(msgid, msgid_plural, n)`
* `s_(msgid)`

The semantic is similar to the Ruby equivalents.

### Angular applications

Purely Angular applications, such as Self-Service UI and ui-components, use [angular-gettext](https://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/) for internationalization.
The `angular-gettext` module allows for annotating parts of the Angular application (HTML of JavaScript), which need to be translated.

Guides for annotating content:

* [HTML files](https://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/dev-guide/annotate/)
* [JavaScript files](https://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/dev-guide/annotate-js/)

Note, that in Self-Service UI, thanks to:

* [N_ alias](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/blob/master/spa_ui/self_service/client/app/config/gettext.config.js#L20)
* [__ alias](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/blob/master/spa_ui/self_service/client/app/config/gettext.config.js#L21)

we can use `N_()` and `__()` in javascript sources instead of regular `angular-gettext` routines (`gettext` and `gettextCatalog.getString`).

#### Substitute filter

In certain situations, it's not possible to correctly annotate strings for translation when these
strings are a value of an HTML element and contain a variable interpolation. For example:

```html
<span tooltip="{{item.v_total_vms}} VMs">
```

This is where the `substitute` filter comes in handy. The above situation would then be resolved as:

```html
<span tooltip="{{ '[[number]] VMs'|translate|substitute:{number: item.v_total_vms} }}">
```

i.e. `[[` and `]]` mark start and end of a variable to be substituted, the actual values would be
then substituted with the context of the `substitute` filter.

#### Caveats

There are certain aspects of using `angular-gettext` you should be aware of.

* **Be careful where you put the `translate` directive**. For example, a markup like:

```html
<div class="outside" translate>
  <div class="inside">
    <span>Text</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

will result in the whole

```html
<div class="inside">
  <span>Text</span>
</div>
```

block being collected during string extraction by `gulp gettext-extract`. Correctly, the `translate` directive should be placed inside the `span` element.

* **Don't use dynamic content inside `__()`**. For example, the following javascript code won't be collected correctly by `gulp gettext-extract`.

```javascript
s = __(sprintf("My name is %s.", me.name));
```

The above should correctly be:

```javascript
s = sprintf(__("My name is %s."), me.name);
```

* **Don't apply the `translate` filter on a dynamic content**. The string inside would not be correctly extracted during string collection. For example the following won't be collected correctly by `gulp gettext-extract`.

```html
<span>
{{ ((magicVariable != null) ? "It's there" : "It's not there") | translate }}
</span>
```

The above should correctly be:

```html
<span>
  <span ng=if="magicVaiable" translate>It's there</span>
  <span ng=if="!magicVariable" translate>It's not there</span>
</span>
```

* **Avoid concatenating English strings.** For example, a javascript code like:

```javascript
if (action.name == "create") {
  var verb = "created";
} else {
  var verb = "updated";
}
message = sprintf(__("Item was %s"), verb);
```

would contain mixed languages when shown in non-English locale.

Correctly, the code should read:

```javascript
if (action.name == "create") {
  message = __("Item was created");
} else {
  message = __("Item was updated");
}

```


### Delayed / dynamic translations

Sometimes we need to delay translation of a string to a later time. For example menu items and sections or certain tree nodes are defined once but then need to be rendered many times possibly in different locales.

In the simplest case you can use `N_('bar')` saying "do not translate this string" such as:

```ruby
menu_item = Menu::Item.new(N_('Cloud Tennants'))
```

and such strings will be caught by the `rake gettext:find` task so these strings end up in the catalog.
Then you do the translation when needed *(e.g. when generating the HTML or JSON format of the data)* by calling `_()` such as:

```ruby
menu_item_text = _(menu_item.text)
```

To properly internationalize a string with interpolation that needs to be translated at render time rather than right away, use `PostponedTranslation` class.

```ruby
tip = PostponedTranslation.new( _N("%s Alert Profiles") ) { "already translated string" }
```

and then in the place where the value is used you will have:

```ruby
translated_tip = tip.kind_of?(Proc) ? tip.call : _(tip)
```

### String interpolation

Whenever you need to use string interpolation inside a gettext call, you need to follow several rules.

* different languages might have different word orders so we **use named placeholders**:

```ruby
_("%{model} \"%{name}\" was added") % {:model => ui_lookup(:model=>"MiqReport"), :name => @rpt.name}
```

These forms **are not acceptable**:

```ruby
_("%s (All %s)" % [@ems_cluster.name, title_for_hosts]) # the name of the placeholder can provide vital information to the translator
_("No %s were selected to move up") % "fields"          # use named placeholder even in the case of a single placeholder
```

* **do not use variables inside gettext strings** as these will not be extracted and placed in the gettext catalog

**Incorrect**:

```ruby
text = "Some random text"
_(text)
```

**Correct**:

```ruby
_("Some random text")
```

### Marking gettext strings in UI

To be able to see strings which pass through gettext *(i.e. are translatable)*, you have to add the following to the servers advanced settings:

```yaml
ui:
  mark_translated_strings: true
```

and **restart** the ManageIQ application. With these settings on, all strings passing through gettext will be marked with `»` and `«` markers:

```
»webui text that went through some of the gettext routines«
```

## Translating ManageIQ

To contribute with translation to ManageIQ, create an account at [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/)
and navigate to the [ManageIQ project page](https://www.transifex.com/manageiq/public/)

### Translator notes

* **How do I translate keys in the form of `Hardware|Usage`? What do they mean?**
  * `Hardware|Usage` means Usage in namespace Hardware. This is the way we translate model attributes for ActiveRecord models for example. You do not have to translate "Hardware", just translate "Usage".

* **What does the key `locale_name` mean?**
  * `locale_name` means name of the given language in the language itself. Such as "Deutsch" for German or "Česky" for Czech. Make sure to provide the value for this key, without it the language/locale cannot be presented in the UI.

## Updating translations (developers)

The general workflow for updating translations is:
* extract strings from source code and create new gettext catalog.
* upload the new catalog into a translation tool *(we use Transifex)*.
* once the translations for the languages are complete, fetch the translations from the translation tool and put them into git.

The instructions will differ in details depending on the specific ManageIQ project.


### Transifex

We use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) for online translations. We maintain several transifex projects for the ManageIQ project:
- [ManageIQ](https://www.transifex.com/manageiq/manageiq/)
- [ManageIQ Service UI](https://www.transifex.com/manageiq/manageiq-service-ui/)

To be able to use transifex from command line, make sure you have `transifex-client` installed and configured ([documentation](https://docs.transifex.com/client))

To be able to manipulate transifex catalogs, you need to be maintainer of the project in transifex.


### ManageIQ (the main project)

Steps for updating translations:

* Update message catalog in the [core](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq) ManageIQ repository. This is done to make sure the message catalog contains up to date (i.e. current) strings for translators.
To update the message catalog including the plugin repos, run the following rake task in the root of `ManageIQ/manageiq` git checkout:

```sh
$ bundle exec rake locale:update_all
```

This task will:
* extract model attributes
* extract strings from `en.yml`
* extract strings from other yaml files
* extract strings from ruby, javascript and haml sources
* extract strings from all ManageIQ plugins, including node plugins (react-ui-components and ui-components)

Now, commit and push changed files into git (branch, pull request, etc.). Although all the `locale/*/*.po` files will be updated by this step, make sure that only the following file is committed:

```
locale/manageiq.pot
```

* Upload the catalog created in previous step to [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/):

```sh
$ cd locale
$ tx push --source
```

Now translators in Transifex will have the latest stuff to translate available.

* Once the translators finish translations of a particular language, pull the translated catalog from Transifex back to ManageIQ repository.

Run the following in ManageIQ git checkout:

```sh
$ cd locale
$ tx pull --all    # use --language option, if you wish to download only specific locales
$ bundle exec rake locale:po_to_json
```

If you are adding new locales / languages to ManageIQ, don't forget to create yaml file containing localized names of each included
language. From the root of ManageIQ checkout, run the following:

```sh
$ bundle exec rake locale:extract_locale_names
```

This will update `config/human_locale_names.yaml` file.

Now commit and push the changes (branch, pull request, etc.). Make sure that in core ManageIQ you commit the following files:

```
locale/*/*.po
config/human_locale_names.yaml        # optionally, if you added locales
```

and in ManageIQ UI Classic repository, commit the following files:
```
app/assets/javascripts/locale/*/*.js
app/javascript/packs/bootstrap-datepicker-languages.js # optionally, if the file changed
```


### ManageIQ Self Service UI

* Update the gettext catalogs:

```sh
$ cd client
$ gulp gettext-extract
```

* Upload the catalogs to [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/):

```sh
$ tx push --source
```

* Once the translations are complete, download the translated catalogs:

```sh
$ tx pull --all    # use --language option, if you wish to download only specific locales
```

* Convert the translated .po catalogs into .json files:

```sh
$ gulp gettext-compile
```

* Update locale names:

```sh
$ gulp available-languages
```

* Commit and push the new content into git:

```sh
$ git commit client/gettext/po client/gettext/json
$ git push
```


## Fast-forwarding translations from release branch to master branch

Ordinarily, translations for ManageIQ are done for particular release and the strings for translations are therefore taken from a release branch. When the translation work for the release branch is done, it is a good practice to fast-forward the translations from the release branch to the master branch. One way to do the fast-forward is to utilize Transifex. The following example assumes fast forward from jansa branch to master:
1. Run `bundle exec rake locale:update_all` in ManageIQ core on master branch
2. Take `locale/manageiq.pot` generated in the previous step and upload it to Transifex to master resource
3. In ManageIQ core git checkout, switch to the jansa branch
4. Upload the language catalogs `locale/${lang}/manageiq.po` from the jansa branch to Transifex, master resource
5. Once you upload the language catalogs from previous step, Transifex will do all the matching & merging of strings
6. In ManageIQ core git checkout, switch to the master branch
7. Download the newly merged language catalogs from Transifex master resource and commit them to the git master branch
