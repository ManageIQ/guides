## Debugging ManageIQ with Remote Pry

Interactive debugging using pry or byebug is normally difficult with ManageIQ, as worker processes are generally run in the background. Therefore the only way to do interactive debugging is with `pry-remote` or `byebug` running in remote mode.

Running ManageIQ with `byebug` was exceedingly slow, so this guide will focus on remote debugging using `pry`.

### Adding dependencies

You'll need to add the following gems to your dev overrides file in `bundler.d/`:

```ruby
  gem 'pry'
  gem 'pry-remote'
  gem 'pry-nav'
```

### Starting the debugger

Setting a breakpoint with `pry` requires adding the following line somewhere in your code:

```ruby
#code executes until this line
binding.remote_pry
#code here does not execute
```

When execution reaches the `remote_pry` call, the line  `pry-remote] Waiting for client on drb://localhost:9876` will print to STDOUT (stderr?) and execution will block until you connect the client debug process.

To connect the debugger, simply run from the ManageIQ root dir:
```
bundle exec pry-remote
```
which will attempt to connect to the pry server on port 9876.

With the addition of `pry-nav`, you'll have access to commands `continue`, `step`, and `next`, to navigate through your code.

### Notes

Setting breakpoints from within pry is currently not possible with `pry-nav`. As a workaround, it's possible to set conditional breakpoints throughout your code like so:

```ruby

binding.remote_pry

# do some stuff

if @breakpoint_enabled
  binding.remote_pry
end
```

And simply set `@breakpoint_enabled = true` when you reach your first breakpoint to enable the next breakpoint to trigger.

Note that you will have to `continue` to exit out of `pry` and then `bundle exec pry-remote` again to enter into subsequent breakpoints in the same process.
