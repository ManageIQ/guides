## Running the test suites

Each ManageIQ component (providers, UI, vmdb, automation engine, etc.)
contains its own set of specs. Most of them can be run by executing

    $ bundle exec rake

Components that require non-standard invocation of the test suite are
documented in the remaining part of the document.


### Running the vmdb suite

The ManageIQ test database needs to be setup before the test suite can be run.
This is automatically created if you run `bin/setup` or `bin/update`, but can
also be created using `bundle exec rake test:vmdb:setup`.

To run the suite, execute:

    $ bundle exec rake

There are some other test related tasks available and those can be listed by
running

    $ bundle exec rake -T test


### Running the vmdb suite in parallel

The main `vmdb` suite of tests can be run in parallel, utilizing multiple
processor cores. These separate processes run concurrently and are then
collected and reported on together when they all complete their delegated work.
You can run the entire vmdb suite or select spec files within it.

#### Setup

Running tests in parallel requires as many different databases as cores you plan to run on.

To set up these databases, simply execute the following command:

```
$ PARALLEL=true bin/rake test:vmdb:setup
```

#### Run the entire suite in parallel

You can run the entire suite in parallel using the following command:

```
$ PARALLEL=true bin/rake test:vmdb
```

#### Passing RSpec options to the rake tasks

RSpec accepts a `SPEC_OPTS` environment variable to pass command line flags.
This is necessary when you wish to use some command line option with our
built-in rake commands to run the tests.

For example, I may wish to set a particular seed and stop running the tests
immediately on a failure:

```
$ PARALLEL=true SPEC_OPTS="--seed 1234 --fail-fast" bin/rake test:vmdb:setup
```

Note that `--fail-fast` will stop whichever core encountered the error, not
every core at the first error found.

#### Running specific spec files in parallel

You needn't run the entire vmdb suite to take advantage of running tests in
parallel. Use `parallel_rspec` to run specific directories of spec files.

For example, I may have done some work on the front end and want to run the
controller, helper, and view specs specifically:

```
$ parallel_rspec spec/controllers spec/helpers spec/views
```

This will run all of the specs in their respective directories, in parallel.
Note you do not need `PARALLEL=true` using `parallel_rspec`.

**Other tips:**

* You can get creative with searching and globbing patterns to feed to the
  `parallel_rspec` command. For example, I might have recently made some pretty
  drastic changes to role checking code having to do with a method named
  `#role_allows`. To quickly run specs that *might* touch this code, I can pass
  in all tests that mention it directly:

  ```
  $ parallel_rspec `git grep -l role_allows spec`
  ```

* Each core requires a certain amount of overhead involved with loading all of
  the application code, etc. Always running the maximum number of cores
  available isn't always beneficial to fast tests. If you're running a subset
  of tests and parallel_tests reports that you're running a very small number
  of specs across each core, try using fewer cores doing more work instead. You
  can specify the number with the `-n` option.  For example, to run all the
  request specs with four cores:

  ```
  $ parallel_rspec -n 4 spec/requests
  ```

* We use the [parallel_tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests) gem to
  make all of this possible - Go check out the documentation to learn even more
  things you can do with running ManageIQ tests in parallel!


### Running UI specs

Running the test suite for `manageiq-ui-classic` requires a bit more
preparation.

These instructions assume that you have `manageiq` and `manageiq-ui-classic`
cloned into `/home/u/miq/manageiq` and `/home/u/miq/manageiq-ui-classic`
respectively and that both repositores have the right branch checked out.

First, you need to symlink the core repo into spec folder of the UI repo:

    $ ln -s /home/u/miq/manageiq /home/u/miq/manageiq-ui-classic/spec/manageiq

Next, you need to ensure that `/home/u/miq/manageiq/bundler.d/overrides.rb`
file contains a block like this:

    override_gem "manageiq-ui-classic", path: "/home/u/miq/manageiq-ui-classic"

Now you must run `bin/update` from the
`/home/u/miq/manageiq-ui-classic/spec/manageiq` folder, followed by
`bin/update` from the `/home/u/miq/manageiq-ui-classic` folder.

After all this is done, you can run tests as usual:

    $ bundle exec rake

To run the javascript specs in `spec/javascripts/**/*_spec.js` in a headless
browser, you can run

    $ bundle exec rake spec:javascript

For debugging, `rake environment jasmine` runs a webserver listening on
`localhost:8888`.

You can also list all test-related rake tasks by running

    $ bundle exec rake -T spec
