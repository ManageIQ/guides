# Issue and PR Lifecycle and Triage Process

The community holds meetings regularly to triage issues and pull requests across the ManageIQ organizationâ€™s repositories. Attendees include code owners and mergers for the repositories, but all are invited to attend.*This is not a meeting to assign when work will be done.*

Triage meetings are divided into two groups General and API/UI.
  * [Core/Provider triage meetings](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NWNjbGw2dDgzOGluZDJrb3QzanFobW9vNmNfMjAyMDAyMTNUMTgzMDAwWiBjb250YWN0QG1hbmFnZWlxLm9yZw&tmsrc=contact%40manageiq.org&scp=ALL) are usually held weekly and include provider and core repositories
  * [API/UI triage meetings](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NzIxc28ycGtpcnJqcThobjhiMjh2NGQ5N3FfMjAyMDAyMTRUMTQzMDAwWiBjb250YWN0QG1hbmFnZWlxLm9yZw&tmsrc=contact%40manageiq.org&scp=ALL) are also held weekly and include the UI and API repos.


## Core/Provider Issue Triage
* Triage [unassigned issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+-label%3A%22help+wanted%22+no%3Aassignee+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Fmanageiq-release+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fbugzilla_mirror+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fpolisher+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fwrapanapi+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fmanageiq-ui-classic+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fmanageiq-performance+or+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fmanageiq-api+or+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Fui-components+or+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Fmanageiq-consumption+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Freact-ui-components+org%3AManageIQ+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Fmanageiq-v2v+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fmanageiq-ui-service+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Fmanageiq_docs+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Fintegration_tests+user%3AManageIQ+sort%3Acreated-desc+) 
  * Apply [scope labels](https://www.manageiq.org/docs/guides/labels).
  * Assign the issue.  There are three possible outcomes.
    * Assign someone to at least get in on the radar.  This *does not* mean that the assignee is expected to start work on the issue.
    * Apply the `help wanted` label.  This means that while the issue is valid, the team does not have plans to work on it in the near future.
    * Do not assign to anyone and revisit the issue.  In other words, we want to be sure that the issue does not get ignored in perpetuity.
  * Close invalid issues with a comment and/or label as to why it has been closed.
* Review [issues with assignee, but no scope label](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+-label%3Atest+-label%3Aperformance+-label%3Abug+-label%3Aenhancement+-label%3Adocumentation+-label%3Arefactoring+-label%3Acleanup+-label%3A%22technical+debt%22+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Fmanageiq-release+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fbugzilla_mirror+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fpolisher+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fwrapanapi+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fmanageiq-ui-classic+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fmanageiq-performance+or+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fmanageiq-api+or+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Fui-components+or+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Fmanageiq-consumption+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Freact-ui-components+org%3AManageIQ+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Fmanageiq-v2v+-repo%3AManageiq%2Fmanageiq-ui-service+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Fmanageiq_docs+-repo%3AManageIQ%2Fintegration_tests+user%3AManageIQ+sort%3Acreated-desc+).
  * Apply [scope labels](https://www.manageiq.org/docs/guides/labels).

  * `Bug` label
    * If the bug is stale, but not verified, will decide during triage if it should be closed.
    * If the bug is not reproducible, comment back to the opener of the issue for more info. If there is no response, then close after it goes stale. 
  * `Question` label
    * Should not go statle.
    * Can either be answered and closed OR converted to another scope label such as `enhancement` or `bug` with appropriate renaming of the issue title.
  * All other scope labels
    * Should never go stale, either pin or close.
    * If the item is considered reasonable, the issue should be labeled `pinned` to prevent the stale label from being applied.
