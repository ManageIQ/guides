## Actions

* Backport requests and direct PRs
  * If accepted for backport, add `<release>/yes` and remove `<release>/yes?`
  * If not accepted for backport, add `<release>/no` and remove `<release>/yes?`
* Unassigned issues (and PRs)
  * If they have a `question` label
    * Answer the question and close OR convert to another scope label such as `enhancement` or `bug` with appropriate renaming of the issue title.
    * Request more feedback and change the `question` label to `feedback requested`.
  * If they have a `feedback requested` label
    * If the author has responded, treat it like a `question` label, otherwise defer to next triage.
  * If invalid, close with a comment and/or label describing the reason.
  * Assign the issue
    * Assign someone to make them aware of the issue.  This *does not* mean that the assignee is expected to start work on the issue.
    * Apply the `help wanted` label.  This means that while the issue is valid, the team does not have plans to work on it in the near future.
* Issues (and PRs) without scope label
  * Apply [scope labels][]
* Stale issues
  * If they have a `bug` label
    * and the bug is `verified`, decide if it should be closed, otherwise request the author to retest on a newer version.
    * and the bug is not `verified`, comment back to the opener of the issue for more info.  If there is no response, then close after it goes stale again.
  * Other
    * If the issue should be kept, label it `pinned` to prevent the `stale` label from being applied, otherwise close
* Stale PRs
  * Stale and unmergeable PRs are closed automatically
  * @mention the author after 1 month of inactivity
  * Close the PR after 3 months of inactivity
