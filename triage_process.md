# Issue and PR Lifecycle and Triage Process

The community holds meetings regularly to triage issues and pull requests across the ManageIQ organizationâ€™s repositories.  Attendees include code owners and mergers for the repositories.  *This is not a meeting to assign when work will be done.*  If you are interested in following a specific issue or pull request, please [subscribe to it on GitHub].

Triage meetings are divided into two groups Core/Provider and API/UI.
  * [Core/Provider triage meetings][] are usually held weekly and include provider and core repositories
  * [API/UI triage meetings][] are also held weekly and include the UI and API repos.

## Issue Triage
* Triage unassigned issues
  * Assign the issue.  There are three possible scenarios.
    * Assign someone to at least get in on the radar.  This *does not* mean that the assignee is expected to start work on the issue.
    * Apply the `help wanted` label.  This means that while the issue is valid, the team does not have plans to work on it in the near future.
    * Do not assign to anyone and revisit the issue.  In other words, we want to be sure that the issue does not get ignored in perpetuity.
  * Close invalid issues with a comment and/or label as to why it has been closed.
* Review issues with assignee, but no scope label.
  * Apply [scope labels][].
* Review `stale` issues
  * `bug` label
    * If the bug is stale, but not verified, will decide during triage if it should be closed.
    * If the bug is not reproducible, comment back to the opener of the issue for more info. If there is no response, then close after it goes stale.
  * `question` label
    * Should not go stale.
    * Can either be answered and closed OR converted to another scope label such as `enhancement` or `bug` with appropriate renaming of the issue title.
  * All other scope labels
    * Should never go stale, either pin or close.
    * If the item is considered reasonable, the issue should be labeled `pinned` to prevent the stale label from being applied.

## Pull Request Triage
* Review unassigned pull requests.
  * Apply [scope labels][]
  * Assign the pull request.  There are three possible outcomes.
    * Assign someone to at least get in on the radar.  This *does not* mean that the assignee is expected to start work on the issue.
    * Apply the `help wanted` label.  This means that while the issue is valid, the team does not have plans to work on it in the near future.
    * Do not assign to anyone and revisit the issue.  In other words, we want to be sure that the issue does not get ignored in perpetuity.
* Review assigned PRs with no scope label.
  * Apply [scope labels][].
* Review `stale` PRs.
  * Bump via @mention after 1 month of no activity
  * Apply stale label after 3 month of no activity
  * After turns stale and 3 months, close the PR.
  * Stale and unmergeable PRs are closed automatically.
